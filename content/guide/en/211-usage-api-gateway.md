# 2.1 AI large model API gateway site

> This article is provided by **AI LoveMoney [ai.lovemoney.live](https://ai.lovemoney.live)**.

API gateway sites suit users who want to quickly connect to large model capabilities but temporarily do not want to handle overseas account registration, phone number verification, credit card payment, and complex network environments. They are usually operated by service providers that host accounts and payment chains. You only need to top up and obtain an API Key, then enter it into a client or tool that supports OpenAI-compatible interfaces.

## Core advantages

- **Low starting barrier**: Usually no overseas phone number or overseas bank card is required, and you can use it after registering and topping up.
- **Pay as you go**: Top up and deduct as used, without bearing the cost of a full monthly subscription at once.
- **Convenient multi-model access**: Many gateway sites put models such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek behind the same interface.
- **Suitable for tool calls**: Clients such as Chatbox, Cherry Studio, code plugins, and internal scripts can generally connect quickly.

## Limitations and risks

- **Weaker privacy boundary**: Request content passes through the gateway provider, so it is not suitable for transmitting confidential data, business secrets, or highly sensitive personal information.
- **Model quality needs verification**: Some services may have unclear model labels, low-tier models pretending to be high-tier models, rate limits, or reduced context length.
- **Service stability is not fully controllable**: Gateway sites may interrupt service because of quota, risk control, upstream changes, or operational problems.
- **Balance risk**: Do not top up too much at once, especially before you have verified service quality and after-sales responsiveness.

## Suitable users

- People who want to try multiple models at low cost
- People mainly doing light non-confidential conversations, code debugging, translation, or tool integration
- People who do not want to immediately handle overseas accounts, phone numbers, and payment chains
- Small teams that want to validate a business prototype first but are not ready to self-host a gateway

## Practical steps

1. Choose a gateway platform with relatively stable reputation. You can start by learning about the gateway site entries below.
2. After registering an account, top up a small amount first, and do not put too much balance in on first use.
3. Generate an API Key in the backend, and confirm the Base URL, model names, and billing instructions provided by the platform.
4. Enter the API Key and proxy URL in Chatbox, Cherry Studio, a code plugin, or your script.
5. Use simple questions to test response speed, model quality, context length, and whether billing matches expectations.
6. If you want to use it long term, then gradually increase the quota and keep backup platforms to avoid a single point of interruption.

### Suitable scenarios
- Multi-model API calls and team trials
- Scenarios that need invoices or clearer settlement records

### Notes
- A small top-up is still recommended before formal use

## Usage advice

API gateway sites are more suitable for "quick availability" and "low-cost trial and error." They are not suitable as the only entry for highly sensitive data or long-term core business. Whenever customer data, internal code, finance, legal matters, medical information, or identity information is involved, you should first consider more controllable official accounts, self-hosted gateways, or enterprise solutions.
