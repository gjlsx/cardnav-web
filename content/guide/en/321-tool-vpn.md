# VPN and proxy access

> This article is provided by **AI LoveMoney [ai.lovemoney.live](https://ai.lovemoney.live)**.

If the target model restricts direct access from your region, then VPN or other proxy methods are basically the unavoidable first step. The problem many people encounter is not "whether there is a ladder," but "whether the current IP is stable, clean enough, and matches the later registration region."

The advantage of ordinary shared nodes is that they are convenient, cheap, and ready to use; the disadvantage is that the same exit IP may be used by many people at the same time, and once one of them triggers risk control, others may also be affected.

- **Ordinary light use**: For users without long-term high-frequency stability needs, you can first consider using mature proxy services.
- **Advanced stability requirements**: Users who need stable large model sessions or want to prevent account bans are advised to buy an independent overseas VPS node themselves.

The following recommended entries can first be tried with small amounts. After confirming node stability, client compatibility, and access to the target service, decide whether to subscribe long term.

## SSRDOG

## Dog Accelerator

High-performance overseas proxy service, a first choice for stability, with cluster load balancing design and high-speed dedicated lines. It is the first globally to support Hysteria1/2 protocol, based on the latest UDP QUIC technology, with extremely low latency, unaffected by evening peak hours, and 4K opening in seconds. It is very worry-free when used with clients such as Clash/V2ray.

## Self-hosted node on cloud host
<!-- badge="Advanced self-hosting" icon="vps" -->

Regular shared VPN nodes usually have poor IP purity because there are many users. If someone on the same node is banned for violations, it may also affect your account by association.

If you have higher stability requirements, it is recommended to buy a cloud host yourself to build an exclusive node. Currently, vless + reality protocol is recommended. For the specific setup method, after purchasing and configuring the cloud host and logging in via SSH, you can directly ask ChatGPT or Claude for step-by-step setup commands.
