# Cloud server recommendations

> This article is provided by **AI LoveMoney [ai.lovemoney.live](https://ai.lovemoney.live)**.

If you plan to self-host a node, run a reverse proxy program, or want a more controllable network environment, you usually need your own cloud server. For personal or small-scale use by a few people, `1C1G` is often already enough.

When choosing a VPS, mainly look at these things:
- **Route quality and latency**: Choose data center location and China-optimized routes to ensure smooth network when connecting to large models.
- **IP purity check**: The IP used for a self-hosted node should avoid being widely blacklisted or marked high-risk by official services.
- **Price and subscription period**: Compare annual or monthly procurement budgets comprehensively, and choose the most cost-effective configuration tier.
- **Reliable and stable provider**: Prioritize established providers that have operated stably for many years, and avoid shutdowns and loss of contact.

In general, the advantage of established providers is not necessarily the lowest price, but greater stability and easier troubleshooting. Cheap plans are not unusable, but you need to accept higher uncertainty in network quality and IP performance.
